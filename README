# Ptouch-Print
## Fork Info
This specific branch is my personal fork.

## About
ptouch-print is a library, command line tool, and Python wrapper to print labels
on Brother P-Touch printers on Linux.

There is no need to install the printer via CUPS, the printer is accessed
directly via libusb.

The tool was written for and tested with the PT-2430PC, but meanwhile is also
used with others (see "ptouch-print --list-supported")

Compile instructions:

./build.sh

## Issues
If you have any issues with this fork of the tool, feel free to create a Github Issues on this repo.

Please don't bother the original creator of any issues at first, as chances are
any issues are caused by changes in my fork, and not the original library.
